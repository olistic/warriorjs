title: Spaces

A **space** is an object representing a square in the floor. Whenever you sense
an area, often one or multiple spaces (in an array) will be returned.

A space can be empty, or it can have a wall or a unit located at it. One of the
spaces in the floor has the stairs, which you need to climb to move on to the
next level.
