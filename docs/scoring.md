Your objective is to not only reach the stairs, but to get the highest score you
can.

There are many ways you can earn points on a level:

* **Defeat an enemy** to add his max health to your score.

* **Rescue a captive** to earn a reward.

* **Pass the level within the bonus time** to earn the amount of bonus time
  remaining.

* **Defeat all enemies and rescue all captives** to receive a 20% overall bonus.

A total score is kept as you progress through the levels. When you pass a level,
that score is added to your total.
