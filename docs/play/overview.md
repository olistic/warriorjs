In WarriorJS, you wear the skin of a warrior climbing a tall tower to reach _The
JavaScript Sword_ at the top level. Legend has it that the sword bearer becomes
enlightened in the JavaScript language, but be warned: the journey will not be
easy. On each floor, you need to write JavaScript to instruct the warrior to
battle enemies, rescue captives, and reach the stairs alive...

**No matter if you are new to programming or a JavaScript guru, WarriorJS will
put your skills to the test. Will you dare?**
