You can call `getUnit()` on a space to retrieve the unit located there (but keep
in mind that not all spaces have units on them):

```js
const unit = space.getUnit();
```

You can call methods on a unit to know more about it.

## Class Methods

Here are the various methods that are available to you:

### `unit.isBound()`

Determines if the unit is bound.

**Returns**

_(boolean)_: Whether this unit is bound or not.

### `unit.isEnemy()`:

Determines if the unit is an enemy.

**Returns**

_(boolean)_: Whether this is an enemy unit or not.
