title: Warrior
---

The **warrior** is the player-character in WarriorJS, which means it's
controlled by you. To create a warrior, you'll be guided through a two-step
process where you'll determine your warrior's name and the tower you want to
climb. Once created, you'll use the warrior to progress through that tower.

> The warrior and tower combination is usually referred to as a **profile**. The
> number of profiles you can have is unlimited, but you can't use the same
> warrior/tower combination twice.

A warrior has the same attributes that any other unit. It also has abilities and
can be under effects.
