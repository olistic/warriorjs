Your objective is to not only reach the stairs, but to get the highest score you
can.

There are many ways you can earn points on a level:

- **Defeat an enemy** to add his max health to your score.

- **Rescue a captive** to earn a reward.

- **Pass the level within the bonus time** to earn the amount of bonus time
  remaining (each level has a bonus time that decreases turn by turn).

- **Defeat all enemies and rescue all captives** to receive a 20% overall bonus.

But you must be careful, because you can also lose points:

- **Kill a captive** and you'll receive a penalty.

A total score is kept as you progress through the levels. When you pass a level,
that score is added to your total.
