WarriorJS uses NPM/Yarn, so any WarriorJS related project can live on
[npm](https://npmjs.com).

Official WarriorJS packages live under the
[@warriorjs scope](https://npmjs.com/org/warriorjs), whereas community packages
should be prefixed with `warriorjs-`. Please also put the keywords "warriorjs"
and "warriorjs-tower" (if you're publishing a tower) in package.json's keywords
field.
