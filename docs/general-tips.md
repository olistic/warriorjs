* **If you ever get stuck on a level, review the README** and be sure you're
  trying each ability out.

* **If you can't keep your health up, be sure to rest when no enemy is around**
  (while keeping an eye on your health). Also, try to use far-ranged weapons
  whenever possible (such as the bow in the beginner tower).

* **Senses are cheap, so use them liberally.** Store the sensed information to
  help you better determine what actions to take in the future.

* **If you're aiming for points, remember to sweep the area.** Even if you're
  close to the stairs, don't go in until you've gotten everything (if you have
  the health). Use far-ranged senses (such as "look" and "listen" in the
  beginner tower) to determine if there are any enemies left.
