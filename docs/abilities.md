An **ability** is a skill possessed by a unit. As the player, you activate
abilities during your warrior's turn.

> Ability selection is the way you can customize how your warrior plays.

## Learning new abilities

When you first start, your warrior will only have a few abilities. Additional
abilities are acquired progressing through the tower. With each level, you'll
learn new things or find artifacts that will expand your capabilities.

## Ability types

There are two types of abilities: actions and senses.

### Actions

An **action** is an ability that affects the game in some way. Is through
actions that you're able to inflict damage, protect yourself or other units, and
interact with your environment.

> Only one action can be performed per turn, so choose wisely.

### Senses

A **sense**, on the contrary, doesn't affect the game but gathers information
about the floor. You can perform senses as often as you want per turn to collect
information about your surroundings and to aid you in choosing the best action
according to the circumstances.

> Since what you sense will change each turn, you may want to record the
> information you gather for use on the next turn. For example, you can
> determine if you are being attacked if your health has gone down since the
> last turn.
