The `playTurn` method in `Player.js` gets passed an instance of your warrior's
turn. The methods you can call on that turn are determined by the abilities your
warrior has available in the current level. See the README in your profile's
directory to find that out.

Here is an example extracted from the README of the second level in the beginner
tower:

```markdown
### Abilities

#### Actions

- `warrior.attack()`
- `warrior.walk()`

#### Senses

- `warrior.feel()`
```

In this level, your warrior has the abilities "attack", "feel", and "walk",
which means you can call these three methods on your turn: `warrior.attack()`,
`warrior.feel()`, and `warrior.walk()`.

> Many abilities can be performed in the following directions: "forward",
> "backward", "left", and "right". You have to pass a string with the direction
> as the first argument, e.g. `warrior.walk('backward')`.
