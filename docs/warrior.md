title: Warrior
---

A **warrior** is a character controlled by you. To create a warrior, you're
guided through a two-step process where you determine your warrior's name and
the tower you want to climb. Once created, you use the warrior to progress
through that tower.

The warrior and tower combination is usually referred to as a **profile**. The
number of profiles you can have is unlimited, but you can't use the same warrior
name/tower combination twice.

## Attributes

* **Health**: the total damage the warrior may take before dying, measured in
  Health Points (HP).
* **Max Health**: the starting Health value.
