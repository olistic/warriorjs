A **warrior** is a character controlled by you. To create a warrior, you'll be
guided through a two-step process where you'll determine your warrior's name and
the tower you want to climb. Once created, you'll use the warrior to progress

> The warrior and tower combination is usually referred to as a **profile**. The
> number of profiles you can have is unlimited, but you can't use the same
> warrior/tower combination twice.
