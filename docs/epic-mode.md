title: Epic Mode
---

Once you reach the top of the tower, you'll have the option to enter **epic
mode**. If you choose so, running `warriorjs` again will run your current
`Player.js` through all levels in the tower without stopping.

You'll most likely not succeed the first time around in epic mode. If that's the
case, you'll need to make adjustments to your warrior by editing `Player.js`.

Once your warrior reaches the top again, you will receive a grade for each
level, along with an average grade for the tower. The grades, from best to
worst, are: S, A, B, C, D, and F. Try to get an S on each level for the ultimate
score!
