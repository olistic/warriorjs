## El Aguila - beginner - level 1

### _You see before yourself a long hallway with stairs at the end. There's nothing in the way._

> **TIP:** Call `warrior.walk()` to walk forward in the Player's `playTurn`
> method.

### Floor Map

```

### Abilities

#### Actions (only one per turn)

* `warrior.walk()`: Move one space in the given direction (forward by default).

#### Senses

* `warrior.think()`: Think about your options before choosing an action
  (`console.log` replacement).

### Next Steps

When you're done editing `Player.js`, run the `warriorjs` command again.
