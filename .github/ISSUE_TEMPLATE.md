⚠️ PLEASE READ BEFORE DELETING THIS TEMPLATE! ⚠️

Thanks for your contribution. Please follow this guide before submitting an
issue:

1. Do you have a setup/usage question?
================================

- Look for prior or closed issues (but please avoid replying to them if they're
  too old).
- Check the docs: https://warrior.js.org/docs
- Start a thread on our Spectrum Help channel:
  https://spectrum.chat/warriorjs/help

2. Do you think you found a bug?
================================

- Make sure you're on the latest version of WarriorJS (`npm i -g @warriorjs/cli`)
- Consider submitting a PR with a failing test instead.
- Use the "BUG TEMPLATE" below to report a bug.
- Don't forget to provide reproduction steps.
- If you can't provide a reproduction, snippets of code can help, but are
  incomplete reports.

3. Do you have a feature request?
================================

- Look for old & closed issues (replying might be ok if they're not too old or
  have no conclusion).
- Otherwise: Remove this entire template and provide thoughtful commentary *and
  code samples* on what this feature means for you. Example:
  - What will it allow you to do that you can't do today?
  - How will it make current work-arounds straightforward?
  - What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid?
  - Please keep it product-centric.
